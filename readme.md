# Turkish Name Parser
This is a simple parser that parses Turkish names and tries to validate them. Characters, tags and numbers are stripped and what remaines is evaluated. Names with single letters, with no vowels are considered invalid and are stripped from the result. Parser then tries to order names and determine first name, middle name and last name.
